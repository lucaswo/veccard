On the Impact of Query Vectorization on Learning-based Cardinality Estimation
====

This GitHub repository contains the python implementation of the four query vectorization techniques presented in the paper
"On the Impact of Query Vectorization on Learning-based Cardinality Estimation".

Structure:
- [`vectorize.py`](./vectorize.py): Implementation of the query vectorization techniques.
- [`query_processing.py`](./query_processing.py): Code to generate queries as used in the evaluation of the paper.
- [`learn_model.py`](./query_processing.py): Code for model training and testing.
