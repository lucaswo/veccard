On the Impact of Query Vectorization on Learning-based Cardinality Estimation
====

This GitHub repository contains the python implementation of the four query vectorization techniques presented in the paper
*On the Impact of Query Vectorization on Learning-based Cardinality Estimation*.

Structure:
- [`vectorize.py`](./vectorize.py): Implementation of the query vectorization techniques.
- [`query_processing.py`](./query_processing.py): Code to generate queries as used in the evaluation of the paper.
- [`learn_model.py`](./query_processing.py): Code for model training and testing.
- [`config`](./config): Folder that contains config files to parameterize scripts.
- create\_plots\_snippets.txt and plot.R: Collection of R instructions we used to generate plots.
